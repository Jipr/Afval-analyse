Here are a few use cases for this project:

1. Environmental Cleanup: Use "Drijfvuil detectie" to assist in identifying and locating different types of litter in urban or natural environments, such as parks, beaches, and waterways, to aid cleanup efforts by volunteers or specialized cleaning robots.

2. Recycling Management: Implement the computer vision model within smart waste management systems to effectively sort and separate different types of waste materials (such as plastic, aluminum, and glass) found in litter items for efficient recycling.

3. Public Awareness Campaigns: Utilize the model's output to create data visualizations and interactive maps highlighting the prevalence of litter in specific areas, raising public awareness about the environmental impact of littering and promoting responsible waste practices.

4. Monitoring Litter Hotspots: Integrate "Drijfvuil detectie" into surveillance systems or mobile apps to monitor litter hotspots in real-time, enabling authorities or community organizations to take immediate action in addressing waste buildup and enforcing anti-littering regulations.

5. Litter Impact Research: Use the model to study the distribution and composition of litter in various ecosystems, helping researchers understand the impact of waste materials on local fauna, flora, and water quality and informing the development of targeted waste reduction initiatives.
